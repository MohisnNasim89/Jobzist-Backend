Project Overview:
Jobzist Backend is the server-side component of the Jobzist job portal platform. It provides a RESTful API for managing users (job seekers, employers, company admins, and super admins), companies, job listings, and applications. The backend integrates with MongoDB for data storage, Cloudinary for file uploads (e.g., resumes and profile pictures), and includes AI-powered features like ATS scoring and cover letter generation. The system is designed to be secure, scalable, and efficient, with middleware for authentication, validation, and rate limiting.

Features:

User Management:

Create, update, and delete user profiles (job seekers, employers, company admins, super admins).
Role-based access control (RBAC) with permissions for different user types.
Connection suggestions for networking.


Company Management:

Create, update, and delete company profiles.
Manage company admins and their permissions.


Job Listings:

Create, update, delete, and toggle job listing status.
Public job search and company-specific job listings.
Apply to jobs and save jobs for later.


Resume Handling:

Upload, edit, and delete resumes.
AI-generated resumes based on user profiles.
Preview and download applicant resumes.


AI Features:

ATS score calculation and suggestions for job applications.
AI-generated cover letters for job applications (rate-limited).


System Administration:

Super admin dashboard to manage users, jobs, companies, and system reports.
Assign and remove admin roles (super admin, company admin).


Security:

JWT-based authentication with verifyToken middleware.
Rate limiting for AI endpoints to prevent abuse.
Input validation for all API routes.


File Uploads:

Secure file uploads for profile pictures, resumes, and media (images, videos) using Cloudinary.
Support for single and multiple file uploads.




Technologies Used

Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
Express.js: Web framework for creating RESTful APIs.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing data (users, companies, jobs, etc.).
Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB to manage schemas and queries.
Cloudinary: Cloud storage for handling file uploads (resumes, profile pictures, media).
Multer: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data file uploads.
JWT (jsonwebtoken): For secure authentication.
Express Rate Limit: Rate limiting for AI endpoints.
Nodemon: For development server auto-restart.
dotenv: For managing environment variables.


Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Version 18.x or higher (tested with v22.11.0).
MongoDB: A running MongoDB instance (local or cloud, e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
Cloudinary Account: For file uploads (profile pictures, resumes, media).
Git: For cloning the repository.


Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jobzist-backend.git
cd jobzist-backend


Install Dependencies:
npm install


Set Up Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/jobzist
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret


PORT: The port your server will run on.
MONGO_URI: Your MongoDB connection string.
JWT_SECRET: A secret key for JWT token generation.
CLOUDINARY_*: Credentials from your Cloudinary dashboard.




Configuration

MongoDB Setup:

Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
Update the MONGO_URI in your .env file with your MongoDB connection string.


Cloudinary Setup:

Sign up for a Cloudinary account and get your credentials (cloud_name, api_key, api_secret).
Add these credentials to your .env file.


Rate Limiting:

The AI endpoints (/ats-score, /cover-letter) are rate-limited to 2 requests per minute per user. Adjust the windowMs and max values in src/middlewares/rateLimiter.js if needed.




Running the Project

Start the Development Server:
npm run dev

This uses nodemon to automatically restart the server on file changes.

Start the Production Server:
npm start


Access the API:The server will run on http://localhost:5000 (or the port specified in your .env file).
